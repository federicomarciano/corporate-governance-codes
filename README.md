# Corporate Governance Codes 
This repository is devoted to storing the codes relate to the Social Corporate Governance research project. 

There are two directories: 

* DoFiles stores the do files. create.do creates the master dataset and tables.do generates tables. It also contains the master dataset on which the project is based. 
* PythonFiles stores the python codes. GreenAccounts2010.py scrapes the green accounts contained in the Danish EPA's database, which are from 2010 onward.
